	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>
		We believe circularity fashion doesn't need to exist only in fast virgin trends. <br />We all
		need to take responsibility to decrease the virgin production of things, the consumerism of this
		society doesn't help the earth or ourselves. <br />We are only, on average, using about 10% of
		our wardrobes clothes, jewellery, shoes and bags. There was no alternative of a boutique
		platform to buy and sell mid to high end pieces, so we made one. <br />We encourage everyone to
		be part of circularity and if you can encourage and inspire someone else to do the same then we
		have an impactful movement.
